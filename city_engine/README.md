CityEngine Data Export Scripts


These scripts allow a user to export street network and block/lot geometry from [ArcGIS CityEngine](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-cityengine/overview). They were originally written in 2019, but they still work on CityEngine 2021. At this point in the development of the software, there may be better mechanisms for accomplishing the same results.
