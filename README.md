# urban_infrastructure
This repository contains source code from several research papers on urban infrastructure systems. The source code includes:
1. Python scripts for [ArcGIS CityEngine](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-cityengine/overview) that allow a user to export street network and block/lot geometry to XML files.
2. Python scripts that allow a user to visualize infrastructure models stored in graphml format.
3. Python scripts that calculate various centrality measures on infrastructure models.

This repository also contains a benchmark set of models that can be used by other researchers.

# requirements
The following Python libraries are required:
1. Graphtools
2. SciPy
3. Numpy
